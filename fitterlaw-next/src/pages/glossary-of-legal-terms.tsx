In English legal history, the courts of "law" could order the payment of damages and could afford no other remedy (see damages). A separate court of "equity" could order someone to do something or to cease to do something (e.g., injunction).

The availability and amount of property the debtor may exempt depends on the state the debtor lives in.<h2>F</h2><h3><strong>Face sheet filing:</strong></h3>A bankruptcy case filed either without schedules or with incomplete schedules listing few creditors and debts.
