<p style="text-align:justify">Fitter Lawâ€™s attorneys understand the interplay of different tax laws and regulations and will work with accountants to help in planning strategies to minimize your businessâ€™ tax liabilities. Many tax laws are written by attorneys, and as such may be very difficult to understand. The different types of tax laws include income tax, corporate and business tax, death tax, property tax, estate and gift tax, sales tax, and international tax. Sometimes taxes are based on an inflated or incorrect value that the taxing authority has placed on your business or activity. Our attorneys will team up with accountants to help you challenge the value, or even the tax itself, and help to reduce your tax burden through careful planning. <br> <br> </p>
