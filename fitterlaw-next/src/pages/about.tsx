		<h4>SMALL FIRM, FULL SERVICE</h4>
<p>Led by founder, <a href="https://fitterlaw.com/about/attorney-jawad-fitter/">Attorney Jawad Fitter</a>, Our lawyers represent clients in multiple practice areas. We encourage our attorneys to collaborate with local counsel where appropriate, and we have established a network of cost-effective resources across the region, enabling us to resolve multi-disciplinary issues in an effective manner.</p>		
		<h4>WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT</h4>
<p>We have each served our time at larger firms, and our collective experience tells us that the traditional firm structure, with its excessive overhead expense and raw attorneys, no longer works for most clients.Â  Our lessons learned include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sophisticated transactions require sophisticated legal skills; not an army of lawyers.</li>
<li>For transactional disputes, litigation should be a last resort.</li>
<li>Alternative Fee Arrangements have advantages for both clients and attorneys.</li>
<li>It is better to provide excellent service to 100 clients than mediocre service to 1000.</li>
<li>Community involvement is our privilege.</li>
</ul>
