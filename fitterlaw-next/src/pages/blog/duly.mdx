<h3><h2>Understanding the Legal Definition of Duly</h2>

<p>As a business owner, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of legal terms and their implications. One such term that holds significant importance is duly. In legal terms, duly refers to performing an action or executing a task in a suitable and proper manner, according to the legal requirements and within the boundaries of the law.</p>

<h4>Examples of Duly in Practice</h4>

<p>Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the concept of duly in a business context. When entering into a contract, it is essential to ensure that all parties involved have duly signed the agreement. This means that each party has executed their signature in compliance with the legal requirements, making the contract legally binding.</p>

<p>Another example can be seen in the process of holding a shareholders' meeting. To conduct a meeting duly, it is necessary to follow the legal procedures outlined in the company's bylaws or applicable laws. This includes providing proper notice to shareholders, ensuring a quorum is present, and following the prescribed voting procedures.</p>
