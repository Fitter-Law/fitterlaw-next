		<p>Â </p><p>As an entrepreneur or corporate leader, understanding fiduciary duties is critical for sound corporate governance and protecting your company from legal risks. In this article, we'll dive into what fiduciary duties are, the two main types of duties, and best practices to ensure you and your board are fulfilling your obligations.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">What are Fiduciary Duties?</h2><p>At their core, fiduciary duties are the legal responsibilities that directors and officers owe to the company and its shareholders. When you take on a leadership role, the law requires you to put the company's interests ahead of your own and make decisions in good faith.</p><p>Think of it like being a trustee or caretaker. Shareholders are entrusting you with the stewardship of their assets and relying on you to manage them prudently. Just like you'd expect a trustee to handle your money carefully and not misuse it for their own benefit, shareholders expect corporate leaders to always put the company first.</p><p>Fiduciary duties exist to protect shareholders and keep leaders accountable. They're a check and balance against the immense power and control that corporate leaders wield. Without fiduciary duties, there would be little to stop unethical leaders from looting the company or running it into the ground for their own gain.</p><p>The two main fiduciary duties are the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. You can think of them as the twin pillars that hold up the entire framework of corporate governance. Every decision you make as a leader will be viewed through the lens of these duties. Did you carefully consider the relevant information? Were you acting in the company's best interests? Keeping these duties front and center is essential for sound governance.</p><p>Breaching fiduciary duties can have severe consequences. Shareholders can sue directors and officers personally, and in some cases executives have even faced criminal charges for violating their duties. While we'll discuss how to protect yourself later on, the best defense is to intimately understand these duties and strive to fulfill them to the highest standard. Let's take a closer look at each one.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">The Duty of Care</h2><p>The duty of care requires corporate leaders to make prudent, informed decisions. You must act with the care and diligence that a reasonable person would use in similar circumstances. Essentially, it's about doing your homework and exercising your best judgment.</p><p>Here's a simple example. Let's say your startup is considering acquiring another small company. To fulfill your duty of care, you'll need to thoroughly vet the deal - review the financials, understand how the business operates, identify the key risks and benefits. You can't just rubber stamp the acquisition because the founder thinks it's a good idea. Your job is to apply independent, objective judgment to determine if it's really in the company's best interests.</p><p>The duty of care also means staying informed about the company's operations. You should understand how the business makes money, the competitive landscape, the key challenges on the horizon. Regularly review financial statements, strategic plans, and risk assessments. If you spot issues, raise them promptly with management and your fellow directors.</p><p>Part of being diligent is knowing when you need outside help. The business world is complex, and no one can be an expert in everything. If your company is implementing a new accounting system and you're not a CPA, it's prudent to consult with an accounting professional who can flag any issues. If you're considering an IPO, work closely with lawyers who specialize in securities law. Don't let pride keep you from seeking advice.</p><p>Exercising care is an active, ongoing process. It's not something you do once and forget about. Prudent leaders are always learning, questioning, and re-evaluating. Think of it like tending a garden - you have to constantly monitor and nurture it, not just plant the seeds and walk away.</p><p>Documenting your diligence is also key. Keeping detailed records of your decision-making process, like board minutes, presentations, and expert reports, creates a valuable paper trail. If your judgment is ever questioned, you'll be able to point to concrete evidence of the care you exercised.</p><p>The courts recognize that running a business involves risk and uncertainty. You're not expected to be omniscient or perfect. But you are expected to use sound processes and act in good faith. Focus on making thoughtful, fully informed decisions, and you'll go a long way towards fulfilling this critical duty.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">The Duty of Loyalty</h2><p>The duty of loyalty is all about putting the company's interests first. When you're a corporate leader, you have to set aside your own personal interests and do what's best for the business and its shareholders. You're there to serve the company, not to serve yourself.</p><p>This can come into play in many ways, big and small. At the most basic level, you can't use company resources for your own personal benefit. That means no buying yourself extravagant gifts on the corporate card or funneling contracts to your cousin's firm. Company assets are there to be invested back into the business, not to line your own pockets.</p><p>Conflicts of interest are a major red flag for the duty of loyalty. Let's say you're an executive at a startup looking to hire a new accounting firm. If your sister-in-law happens to run an accounting practice, that's a clear conflict. Even if she would do a great job, you can't let your personal relationship sway your professional judgment. The right thing to do is disclose the connection and recuse yourself from the hiring decision.</p><p>The same goes for corporate opportunities. If you learn about a great potential investment through your role at the company, your first obligation is to present that opportunity to the company. Only if the company decides to pass on it can you pursue it individually. You can't secretly scoop up deals that could benefit your company and keep them for yourself.</p><p>Insider trading is another classic loyalty issue. If you get advance word that your company is about to announce a big acquisition, you can't race to buy stock before the news goes public. That's abusing insider knowledge for personal gain, and it's a serious breach of loyalty.</p><p>The duty of loyalty requires constant vigilance. Conflicts can crop up in subtle ways, and it's not always clear cut what's right. The key is to be rigorously honest with yourself. Before making any decision, ask: Am I doing this because it's best for the company, or am I motivated by some personal interest? When in doubt, err on the side of caution and transparency. Disclose potential conflicts early and often, and get board input on thorny situations.</p><p>Setting the right tone from the top is critical. As a leader, how you act sends a powerful signal to the rest of the company. If you play fast and loose with corporate assets, others will follow suit. But if you visibly put the company first and hold yourself to the highest ethical standards, that integrity will ripple throughout the organization. Never forget, a strong culture of loyalty starts with you. &lt;/section3&gt;</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Practical Steps to Fulfill Your Duties</h2><p>We've covered the key concepts behind fiduciary duties - the need for care, loyalty, and good faith. But what does that look like in practice? Here are some concrete steps you can take to fulfill your duties and protect yourself and your company:</p><ol><li>Be an active, engaged leader. It's not enough just to show up to board meetings. To exercise true care and diligence, you need to dive deep into the business. Review financial statements line by line. Grill the management team on strategy and results. Visit facilities and talk to employees on the front lines. The more you know about the day-to-day realities of the company, the better equipped you'll be to make prudent decisions.</li><li>Voice your independent judgment. Dissent can be uncomfortable, but it's a critical part of your job. If management proposes a plan that you think is reckless, speak up. If a fellow director has a conflict of interest they're not disclosing, say something. The boardroom should be a place for vigorous, thoughtful debate. As the saying goes, you can disagree without being disagreeable. Frame your concerns objectively, and be open to other perspectives. But don't let groupthink sway you from your convictions.</li><li>Put strong governance practices in place. Designing the right governance structure is key to fulfilling your duties. Create board committees (audit, compensation, governance, etc.) with clear charters outlining their responsibilities. Set a regular cadence of meetings with agendas that force deep discussion of key issues. Establish written policies on things like conflicts of interest, insider trading, and risk oversight. Not only do these steps help you exercise care and loyalty, they also create a valuable paper trail showing your diligence.</li><li>Disclose, disclose, disclose. The clearest way to avoid conflicts of interest is to put them out in the open early. Adopt a policy requiring directors and officers to regularly disclose any potential conflicts, like family relationships with vendors or ownership stakes in competitors. When a conflict does arise, err on the side of over-disclosing. Proactively tell the board why you may be conflicted and how you're going to recuse yourself. Transparency is the best disinfectant.</li><li>When in doubt, seek expert advice. Fulfilling your duties isn't about being perfect - it's about being prudent. And part of prudence is knowing when you need help. If you're facing a complex legal question, bring in outside counsel. If there are accounting red flags, engage forensic accountants. You don't have to become an expert in every field, but you do need to identify when expert advice is required.</li><li>Document everything. When it comes to fiduciary duties, the process can be as important as the result. Carefully document the steps you took to reach a decision. Save the emails, presentations, and reports you relied on. Have the board minutes reflect the questions asked and answered. If you ever end up in court, being able to retrace your path with a clear paper trail can be an invaluable defense.</li><li>Invest in ongoing education. Fiduciary duties aren't something you learn once and master. The expectations for corporate leaders are always evolving, and new issues emerge with every passing year. Make a commitment to continuous learning. Attend industry conferences to stay abreast of governance trends. Read academic papers and legal journals. Pick the brains of people you respect who've served on other boards. The broader your knowledge base, the better you'll be at exercising your duties.</li></ol><p>Fulfilling your fiduciary duties is both a legal requirement and an ethical imperative. The trust placed in you as a corporate leader is immense, and the consequences of abusing that trust can be dire. But by following the practices outlined here - exercising diligence, disclosing conflicts, documenting decisions, and always striving to put the company first - you can meet these weighty responsibilities. You can be the kind of leader your shareholders, employees, and partners deserve.</p>
