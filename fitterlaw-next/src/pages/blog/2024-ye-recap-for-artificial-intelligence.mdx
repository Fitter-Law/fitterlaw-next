		<article><h1>AI Startup Landscape in 2024</h1><p>2024 saw a surge in AI startups, with over 2,500 new companies emerging globally, a 40% increase from the previous year. While many were early-stage ventures, around 20% secured significant funding or achieved key milestones. In total, AI startups raised over $50 billion in investment capital in 2024. Although most remained pre-revenue, some later-stage companies collectively generated an estimated $5 billion in revenue. The rapid growth highlighted the intense interest and potential in the AI sector.</p><h2>ChatGPT-4o Launch</h2><p>OpenAI released ChatGPT-4o, an optimized version of its conversational AI model, in September 2024. ChatGPT-4o delivers improved performance, efficiency, and scalability compared to previous iterations while maintaining high-quality language understanding. This update has made ChatGPT more accessible and cost-effective for businesses to integrate into their workflows for customer support, content generation, and other applications.

By accurately predicting the 3D structures of most known proteins, AlphaFold 3 has opened new avenues for understanding diseases, developing novel drugs, and advancing bioengineering. This breakthrough is expected to accelerate research in fields like personalized medicine and synthetic biology.
