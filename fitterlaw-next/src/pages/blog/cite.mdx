<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of cite. Citing someone can mean two different things in the legal world. The first definition is to summon someone to appear in court. This is typically done by serving the individual with a summons. The second definition is to quote or refer to a preceding case.

Understanding the legal definition of cite is crucial for any business owner who may find themselves involved in a legal dispute. If you need to take legal action against someone, you will need to properly cite them in order to ensure that they are properly served with a summons. Failure to properly cite someone can result in your case being dismissed.

Citing a preceding case is also important in the legal world. When you cite a case, you are referencing a previous legal decision that is relevant to your current case. This can be helpful in building your argument and supporting your position. It is important to properly cite any cases that you reference in your legal documents to ensure that your argument is strong and credible.

For example, if you are involved in a contract dispute, you may want to cite a previous case that dealt with a similar issue. This can help to support your position and show that your argument is based on legal precedent.
