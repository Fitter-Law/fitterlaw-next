<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of fair market value. Fair market value is the price that a willing buyer and a willing seller would agree to for a particular asset or property. This value is determined by the market and is based on various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, and the condition of the asset or property.

Understanding fair market value is crucial when it comes to buying or selling assets or properties. For example, if you are looking to sell a piece of property, it is important to know the fair market value so that you can price it appropriately. If you price it too high, you may not attract any buyers, and if you price it too low, you may not get the full value of the property.

Similarly, if you are looking to buy an asset or property, knowing the fair market value can help you negotiate a fair price. If the seller is asking for a price that is significantly higher than the fair market value, you can use this information to negotiate a lower price.

It is also important to note that fair market value is not the same as the assessed value or the appraised value. The assessed value is the value that is used by local governments to determine property taxes, while the appraised value is the value that is determined by a professional appraiser.
