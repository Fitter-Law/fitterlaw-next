<h4>Examples of Breach</h4>

<p>Let's delve into a few examples to illustrate the concept of breach. Imagine you own a manufacturing company that has entered into a contract with a supplier to deliver raw materials by a specific date. If the supplier fails to deliver the materials on time, they are in breach of the agreement.</p>
