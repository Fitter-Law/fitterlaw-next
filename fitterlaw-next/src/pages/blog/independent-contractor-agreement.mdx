		<p>An independent contractor agreement, or freelancer agreement, is a legally binding contract between two parties for a particular project or service. An independent contractor agreement is typically presented before the project is to begin. An independent contractor usually has a specialized set of skills that makes them the ideal candidate for the project or desired service. An independent contractor agreement is sometimes paired with a confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement (NDA). In some situations, an independent contractor may have to sign a separate non-compete agreement depending on the nature of the business and scope of work. This sample independent contractor agreement can be used as a guide when drafting your own for your companyâ€™s needs.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Differences Between an Independent Contractor and EmployeeÂ Â Â </strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are some major differences between an independent contractor and an employee. The differences mainly lie within the legal and tax purposes that an employee has that an independent contractor may not. Independent contractors are usually self-employed and use their own equipment. One significant distinction is that independent contractors are responsible for paying their own taxes, whereas, with an employee, the company is responsible for paying state and federal taxes (employment taxes, income taxes, social security). Freelancers are not granted vacation pay, sick pay, or workersâ€™ compensation. Freelancers are also not entitled to unemployment compensation. Independent contractors are not usually entitled to employee benefits and are responsible for obtaining their own health insurance coverage. Most businesses offer employees insurance or other benefit packages. Misclassifying an independent contractor as an employee or vice versa could have serious legal and tax consequences.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How to Customize your Independent Contractor Agreement</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An independent contractor agreement will vary depending on the scope of work, industry, and other related factors. Each state may have different state laws regarding what should and should not be included in an independent contractor agreement. It is a good practice to contact an experienced attorney to review your business contracts.</p>
