All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What data breach procedures we have in place</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
