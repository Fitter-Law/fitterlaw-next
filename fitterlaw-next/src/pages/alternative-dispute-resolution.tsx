<p>Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) refers to a variety of processes that help parties resolve disputes without a trial. Typical ADR processes include arbitration and mediation. </p>

<p class="has-background has-secondary-background-color"><strong>How Arbitration Works:</strong><br><br>When you want to settle a dispute without going to court, you may benefit from the services of Fitter Lawâ€™s Arbitration Lawyers. In arbitration, you and the other involved party select a neutral third person, who acts as an informal judge, to serve as an arbitrator. Unlike a court proceeding, arbitration involves no formal procedural rules and gives you a chance to tell your story in your own words. The arbitrator listens to both sides of the dispute, and after hearing the arguments, the arbitrator makes a final binding decision. The decision is legally enforceable. The arbitration process is very similar to court litigation but is less expensive, flexible, and private.Â  It is typically also less time-consuming.</p>

<p class="has-background has-light-gray-background-color"><strong>How Mediation Works:</strong><br><br>The mediation process can help you resolve disputes without going to court. In a mediation proceeding, a neutral third party--the mediator, meets with you and the person you disagree with. Mediations are more common in personal disputes, such as Family Law disputes, including divorce and child custody. Mediation may also be utilized in business disagreements.Â  Mediators are trained to find solutions in such legal disputes. The mediator helps you negotiate until a solution is found. Mediation is the most informal process for dispute resolution and is usually the least expensive method. In mediation, the parties must agree and enter into a settlement agreement. If the parties canâ€™t come to an agreement, the mediation can end without the dispute being solved.Â  Unlike in Arbitration, the mediator does not make a final decision; rather facilitates the process to help the parties resolve their disputes amongst themselves.</p>
