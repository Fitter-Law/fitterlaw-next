<h3><h2>Legal Definition of Speaker: A Key Role in Legislative Bodies</h2>

<h4>Examples of the Speaker's Role</h4>

<p>To better grasp the significance of the Speaker's role, let's consider a few examples.

They are responsible for moderating debates, interpreting rules, and making rulings on procedural matters. Additionally, the Speaker often represents the legislative body in external affairs and acts as a spokesperson for its decisions and policies.</p>

<h4>The Importance of the Speaker</h4>

<p>The role of the Speaker is of utmost importance in legislative bodies. They serve as a neutral arbiter, ensuring that debates are conducted in an orderly manner and that all members have an opportunity to express their views. By maintaining decorum and enforcing rules, the Speaker helps to uphold the integrity of the legislative process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Speaker's authority in shaping the agenda and allocating speaking time allows for efficient and effective decision-making.
