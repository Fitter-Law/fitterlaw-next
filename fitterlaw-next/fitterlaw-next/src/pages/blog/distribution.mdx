<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of distribution. Distribution refers to the transfer of the assets of a deceased person's estate to their heirs, after all debts, claims, and taxes have been paid. This process is also known as probate.

Probate can be a complex and time-consuming process, but it is necessary to ensure that the deceased person's assets are distributed according to their wishes and in accordance with the law. Failure to properly distribute assets can result in legal disputes and financial losses for the heirs.

There are several types of distribution, including per stirpes and per capita. Per stirpes distribution means that the assets are divided among the deceased person's descendants by branch of the family. For example, if one of the deceased person's children has passed away, their share of the assets would be divided among their own children. Per capita distribution means that the assets are divided equally among all of the deceased person's descendants, regardless of their relationship to the deceased.

It is important to note that distribution only occurs after all debts, claims, and taxes have been paid. This means that creditors and other claimants may have a right to a portion of the deceased person's assets before they are distributed to the heirs.

As a business owner, it is important to have a plan in place for the distribution of your assets in the event of your death. This may include creating a will or trust, designating beneficiaries for your retirement accounts and life insurance policies, and ensuring that your business interests are properly accounted for.
