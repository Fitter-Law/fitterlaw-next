<h3>As a business owner, it is important to have a clear understanding of the legal definition of Congress. In America, Congress is composed of two legislative bodies, the Senate and the House of Representatives. These two bodies work together to create and pass laws that affect our daily lives.

However, Congress also has a broader definition in international law. It refers to an assembly of representatives from different countries who meet to consider matters for their common good. This type of Congress is essential for promoting international cooperation and resolving global issues.

For example, the United Nations General Assembly is a type of Congress that brings together representatives from all member countries to discuss and address global issues such as climate change, human rights, and international security.

Understanding the legal definition of Congress is important for business owners because it can impact international trade and relations. It is essential to stay informed about the decisions and actions of Congress, both domestically and internationally, to ensure that your business is prepared for any potential changes or challenges.
