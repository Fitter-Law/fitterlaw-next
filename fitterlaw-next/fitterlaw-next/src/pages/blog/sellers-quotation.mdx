<h3><h2>Legal Definition of Seller's Quotation</h2>
<p>A seller's quotation, in the context of business transactions, refers to prior correspondence, offers, bids, or general advertisements that a buyer has relied upon or accepted. It serves as a legally binding agreement between the seller and the buyer, outlining the terms and conditions of the transaction.</p>

<h4>Examples of Seller's Quotation</h4>
<p>Let's consider a hypothetical scenario to better understand the concept. Imagine you own a manufacturing company that produces electronic gadgets. You receive an inquiry from a potential buyer who is interested in purchasing a large quantity of your products. In response, you provide them with a detailed quotation that includes the price, quantity, delivery terms, and any other relevant information.</p>

<p>If the buyer accepts your quotation and places an order based on the terms outlined in the quotation, it becomes a seller's quotation. This means that both parties are legally bound by the terms and conditions specified in the quotation.</p>

<h4>The Importance of Seller's Quotation</h4>
<p>The seller's quotation plays a crucial role in business transactions as it provides clarity and transparency between the buyer and the seller. By clearly outlining the terms and conditions, it helps to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes that may arise during the course of the transaction.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a seller's quotation serves as a legal protection for both parties involved. It ensures that the buyer receives the products or services as agreed upon, and the seller receives the payment as per the agreed terms. In case of any breach of contract, the seller's quotation can be used as evidence to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p>From a business owner's perspective, providing a comprehensive and accurate seller's quotation is essential for building trust and maintaining a positive reputation in the market. It demonstrates professionalism, reliability, and a commitment to delivering on promises made to customers.</p>
