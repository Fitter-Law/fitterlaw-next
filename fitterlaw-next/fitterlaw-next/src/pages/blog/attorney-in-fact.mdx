<h3>As a business owner, you may have heard the term attorney-in-fact thrown around in legal discussions. But what exactly does it mean? In simple terms, an attorney-in-fact is an individual who is authorized by a written document to act on behalf of another person. This written document is commonly referred to as a Power of Attorney.

It's important to note that the individual acting as an attorney-in-fact does not need to be an actual attorney. In fact, anyone can be designated as an attorney-in-fact as long as they are authorized by the written document.

So why would someone need to designate an attorney-in-fact? There are many reasons why someone may choose to do so. For example, if you are going to be out of the country for an extended period of time, you may want to designate someone as your attorney-in-fact to handle your financial affairs while you are away. Or, if you become incapacitated and are unable to make decisions for yourself, your designated attorney-in-fact can step in and make decisions on your behalf.

It's important to choose your attorney-in-fact carefully. This person will have a great deal of power and responsibility, so you want to make sure that you trust them completely. You should also make sure that they understand their role and responsibilities as an attorney-in-fact.

Talk to a Fitter Law attorney: an attorney-in-fact is an individual who is authorized by a written document to act on behalf of another person.
