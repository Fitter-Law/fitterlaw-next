<p class="has-drop-cap">If you make a big purchase (i.e.: house, vehicle, major appliances, etc.) and later find out that the goods are defective, what can you do if the business refuses to make good on those defects? You can file a lawsuit and proceed with litigation, but the process can be costly and time-consuming. The law provides several other methods to resolve disputes and all offer unique advantages. An attorney who specializes in disputes reviews your paperwork and tells you what method will best serve your needs and budget. <br> </p>

<p class="has-background has-secondary-background-color"><strong>Securities and Investment Fraud:</strong> <br>If you bought shares in a company whose value was intentionally exaggerated so you would make the investment, you may benefit from the services of Fitter Lawâ€™s securities fraud, or investment fraud, attorneys.Â  Securities fraud is a white-collar crime that has grown over the past several decades. Securities fraud can involve top executives of a public or private company manipulating financial reports, or falsifying tax reports. While itâ€™s not easy for many investment fraud victims to recover their money, Fitter Law will guide you in determining your rights and your chances of recovery before pursuing any action. </p>
