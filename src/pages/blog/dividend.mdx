<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of dividend. In simple terms, a dividend is a portion of a corporation's profits that is distributed to its stockholders. This distribution is usually declared by the board of directors when the corporation is profitable.

For example, let's say that your corporation made a profit of $100,000 in the last quarter. If you have 100,000 shares outstanding, each share would be entitled to $1 of the dividend. The board of directors would then declare a dividend of $1 per share, and each stockholder would receive a payout of $1 for each share they own.

It is important to note that a corporation is not required to declare a dividend, even if it is profitable. The decision to declare a dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors. In some cases, a corporation may choose to reinvest its profits back into the business instead of distributing them to stockholders.

However, failing to declare dividends for a prolonged period of time can have negative consequences for a corporation. Stockholders may become dissatisfied and sell their shares, causing the stock price to drop. This can make it more difficult for the corporation to raise capital in the future.

Talk to a Fitter Law attorney: understanding the legal definition of dividend is crucial for any business owner. While the decision to declare a dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors, failing to do so for a prolonged period of time can have negative consequences. By staying informed and making informed decisions, business owners can ensure the long-term success of their corporation</h3>
