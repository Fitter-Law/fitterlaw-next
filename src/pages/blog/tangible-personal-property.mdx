<h4>Examples of Tangible Personal Property</h4>
<p>Let's delve into some examples to further illustrate the concept. Imagine you own a retail store that sells clothing. The inventory of clothing items you have in stock would be considered tangible personal property. Similarly, if you own a car dealership, the vehicles on your lot would fall under this category as well.</p>

<p>Other examples of tangible personal property include furniture in your office, jewelry you may own, and even the equipment you use to run your business, such as computers, printers, and machinery.</p>
