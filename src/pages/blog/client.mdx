<h3><h2>Legal Definition of Client: Someone who retains or employs an attorney</h2>
<p>As a business owner, it is crucial to understand the legal definition of a client. In the legal realm, a client is defined as someone who retains or employs an attorney. This means that when you hire an attorney to represent you or your business, you become their client.</p>

<h4>Retaining an Attorney</h4>
<p>Retaining an attorney simply means entering into an agreement with them to provide legal services on your behalf. This agreement can be formalized through a written contract or even a verbal agreement. Once you have retained an attorney, they have a legal obligation to act in your best interests and provide you with competent legal advice.</p>

<h4>Employing an Attorney</h4>
<p>Employing an attorney goes beyond just retaining their services. It implies a more ongoing and long-term relationship. When you employ an attorney, you are essentially hiring them as a legal advisor or representative for your business. This can involve regular consultations, legal document drafting, and representation in legal proceedings.</p>

<h4>Importance of Having a Client-Attorney Relationship</h4>
<p>The client-attorney relationship is of utmost importance for any business owner. By having a trusted attorney by your side, you gain access to their expertise and guidance in navigating the complex legal landscape. They can help you understand your rights and obligations, protect your interests, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you are a small business owner facing a potential lawsuit from a dissatisfied customer. By having a client-attorney relationship, you can rely on your attorney to assess the situation, provide legal advice, and represent your interests in court if necessary. This can significantly increase your chances of a favorable outcome and minimize potential damages.</p>
