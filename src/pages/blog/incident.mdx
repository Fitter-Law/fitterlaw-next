They can be events or happenings that occur within your business operations, affecting various aspects of your organization.</p>

<h4>Examples of Incidents</h4>

This incident is directly connected to the condition of your store and can have legal implications. Another example could be a data breach in your company's online systems, compromising sensitive customer information. Such incidents can lead to financial losses, damage to your reputation, and potential legal consequences.</p>

<h4>The Importance of Understanding Incidents</h4>
