<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of tenancy in common. This term refers to the possession of property by two or more people, where each party possesses an undivided interest in the entire property. This is different from a situation where each party owns a designated portion of the property, such as land.

For example, imagine that you and your business partner decide to purchase a commercial property together. If you choose to hold the property as tenants in common, you will each have an undivided interest in the entire property. This means that you both have the right to use and occupy the entire property, and you are both responsible for paying any expenses related to the property, such as taxes and maintenance costs.

One of the benefits of holding property as tenants in common is that it allows for flexibility in ownership. Each party can own a different percentage of the property, and they can sell or transfer their interest in the property without the consent of the other parties. This can be particularly useful in situations where one party wants to sell their interest in the property, but the other parties do not.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to holding property as tenants in common. For example, if one party dies, their interest in the property will pass to their heirs or beneficiaries, rather than to the other tenants in common. This can lead to complications if the heirs or beneficiaries do not want to continue owning the property with the other parties.

Talk to a Fitter Law attorney: understanding the legal definition of tenancy in common is important for business owners who are considering purchasing property with others. While there are benefits to holding property as tenants in common, there are also potential drawbacks that should be carefully considered before making a decision. As always, it is important to seek the advice of a qualified attorney before entering into any legal agreements</h3>
