<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of adjournment. In simple terms, adjournment means to conclude a meeting until another time. This can be a crucial aspect of any business meeting, as it allows for the discussion to continue at a later time, without having to start from scratch.

One example of when adjournment may be necessary is during a board meeting. If there are multiple items on the agenda, and the meeting is running long, it may be necessary to adjourn the meeting and continue the discussion at a later time. This allows for all items to be properly discussed and addressed, without rushing through them or leaving them unfinished.

Another example of when adjournment may be necessary is during a legal proceeding. If a trial is running long, the judge may adjourn the proceedings until the next day, or until a later date. This allows for all parties involved to properly prepare and present their case, without feeling rushed or unprepared.

It is important to note that adjournment should not be used as a way to avoid making a decision or to delay action. Rather, it should be used as a tool to ensure that all parties involved have the necessary time to properly address the issue at hand.
