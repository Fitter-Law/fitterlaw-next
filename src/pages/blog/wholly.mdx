<h3><h2>Legal Definition of Wholly: Completely; entirely; exclusively; the opposite of partially.</h2>

<p>As a business owner, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of legal terms that may impact your operations. One such term is wholly, which holds significant importance in various legal contexts. In simple terms, wholly refers to something that is complete, entire, or exclusive, and stands in direct contrast to the concept of partiality.</p>

<h4>Examples of Wholly:</h4>

<p>To better grasp the concept, let's consider a few examples:</p>

<p><strong>1. Wholly-owned subsidiary:</strong> In the corporate world, a wholly-owned subsidiary is a company that is entirely owned and controlled by another company, known as the parent company. This means that the parent company has full ownership and control over all aspects of the subsidiary's operations, including its assets, liabilities, and decision-making processes.</p>

<p><strong>2. Wholly-owned property:</strong> When an individual or entity owns a property wholly, it means they have complete ownership rights over the entire property. This includes both the land and any structures or improvements on it. The owner has exclusive control and can make decisions regarding the property without any external interference.</p>

<p><strong>3. Wholly exclusive contract:</strong> In contractual agreements, a wholly exclusive contract refers to an agreement where one party grants exclusive rights or privileges to another party. This means that the rights or privileges provided under the contract are entirely reserved for the recipient, and no other party can benefit from them.</p>
