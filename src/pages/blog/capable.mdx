<h3>As a business owner, it is important to understand the legal definition of capable. Capable refers to being competent and having legal power or qualifications. This term is often used in legal documents and contracts, and it is crucial to understand its implications.

Being capable means that you have the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to perform a task or fulfill a responsibility. For example, if you are hiring an employee, you want to ensure that they are capable of performing the job duties. This means that they have the necessary qualifications, such as education or experience, to do the job effectively.

In addition to being competent, being capable also means having legal power. This means that you have the authority to make decisions and take actions that are legally binding. For example, if you are a business owner, you have the legal power to enter into contracts on behalf of your company.

It is important to note that being capable is not just about having the necessary skills and legal power. It also involves being mentally and emotionally stable. If someone is not mentally or emotionally capable, they may not be able to make sound decisions or fulfill their responsibilities effectively.

To illustrate the importance of being capable, let's consider a scenario. Imagine that you are a business owner who is looking to hire a new manager. You receive two resumes, one from a candidate who has the necessary qualifications and experience, and another from a candidate who does not have the necessary qualifications but is eager to learn. While the second candidate may have potential, they are not currently capable of performing the job duties. As a business owner, it is important to hire someone who is capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the position.
