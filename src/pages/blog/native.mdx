<h4>What Does Native Mean?</h4>

<p>The legal definition of native refers to a natural-born citizen, someone who was born in the country of which they hold citizenship. This definition implies that individuals who are born in a particular country automatically acquire citizenship by birthright. It is important to note that the concept of native is closely tied to the principle of jus soli, or the right of the soil.</p>

<p>Furthermore, understanding native status can also help you foster a diverse and inclusive work environment. By recognizing the rights and privileges that come with native status, you can ensure equal treatment and opportunities for all employees, regardless of their citizenship.</p>



<p>Having a clear understanding of the legal definition of native is crucial for business owners. It enables compliance with labor laws, facilitates international business operations, and promotes diversity and inclusion.
