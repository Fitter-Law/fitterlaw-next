In the legal realm, the term predecessor refers to a person who comes before or goes ahead of another individual. This concept is commonly used to establish a chronological order or hierarchy, particularly in the context of leadership positions or official roles. For instance, President Ford served as President Carter's predecessor in office, indicating that Ford held the position before Carter assumed it.

<h4>Examples of Predecessors</h4>
